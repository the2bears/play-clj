## Introduction

A fork of Zach Oakes Clojure game library [play-clj](https://github.com/oakes/play-clj)

## Justification

Just some small changes, namely if you want Box2D shapes to map correctly with textures you need to use this version.

## Licensing

Per Zach's original license: all files that originate from this project are dedicated to the public domain. I would love pull requests, and will assume that they are also dedicated to the public domain.
